This is the start of a Waluigi soundboard with a song that plays in the background.

Its dumb, its silly, and its fun.

I'm putting it under the Apache 2 license if you want to use it, but I don't suggest using it in any way that isn't fair use. I'm using copyrighted assets to learn various media manipulation in python.

All rights go to their respective copyright holders.

#Plans for the Future:
- Random Audio Editor (saves audio, doesn't just play the tracks)
- Image Editor where Waluigi Photo Bombs the given image
- Facial Recognition where faces are replaced with Waluigi's
